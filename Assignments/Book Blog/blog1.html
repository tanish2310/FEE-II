        <h3>About the book:- </h3>
        <p><b><i>Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E. L. James.[1] It became the first installment in the Fifty Shades
            novel series that follows the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey.
            It contains explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving BDSM (bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism).
           "The Fifty Shades" series belongs to the genre of dark romance.[2] This genre typically involves intricate and dramatic plots, delving into complex and
            profound emotional relationships, along with possibly exploring unconventional or thought provoking themes. The "Fifty Shades" series is categorized as dark
             romance literature due to its romantic elements in the plot and the complexity of interpersonal relationships. Originally self published as an ebook and 
             print-on-demand in June 2011, the publishing rights to Fifty Shades of Grey were acquired by Vintage Books in March 2012, topping best seller lists around
              the world. It has been translated into 52 languages and set a record as the fastest selling paperback of all time in the United Kingdom. Critical reception 
              of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor, while its portrayal of BDSM 
           has been targeted for criticism from a variety of perspectives. Universal Pictures and Focus Features produced an American film adaptation,
            which was released on 13 February 2015,[3] and was also panned upon release, though it was a box office success. The second and third volumes
             of the original trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, were published in 2012. The trilogy had sold over 150 million copies worldwide
              by October 2017. A version of the novel from Christian's point of view, Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian, was published in June 2015
               as the fourth book, followed by Darker: Fifty Shades Darker as Told by Christian in November 2017 and Freed: Fifty Shades Freed as Told by Christian in June 2021.</p>
